# Figures

This folder is for optional figure outputs generated by the notebook.

Figures are generated by `readinessAssistantModel.ipynb` during execution. Files in this folder are optional and for documentation purposes only. They are not required for the notebook to run.

If you save plots or visualizations from the notebook, they can be placed here.
